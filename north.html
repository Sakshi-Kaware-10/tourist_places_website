               With its rich history, Jaipur is a vibrant, flamboyant city that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its majestic past is visible in the form of palaces, some that still are home to the Royal family, forts, and monuments dotting the city. There are also a number of picturesque gardens and lakes in Jaipur. The city balances its heritage with all the conveniences of an urban metropolis as camels and buses share the same space. It is a part of the Golden-Triangle circuit that spread across Jaipur, Delhi, and Agra.</br></p>
