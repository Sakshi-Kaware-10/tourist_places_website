                    erstwhile Wodeyar Maharajas, is believed to be the second most popular tourist site in India.
                    Mysore’s rich traditions and spice bazaars attract tourists from across India and the world. Another
                    popular reason to visit this city is to practice and learn the art of Ashtanga yoga. Mysore Dasara

                    With misty clouds and rolling green hills, Munnar has often been named one of the most picturesque
                    hill stations of South India. It almost seems as though the place is carpeted with tea plantations.
                    A visit here is all the encouragement one needs to sample the different aromas and flavors of tea.
                    For nature lovers, there are elephants to watch, waterfalls to bathe in and trekking trails to walk
                    along. This is also a popular weekend destination in South India. </br>
