            <p>
                <br>
                Lying on the western coast, Goa is India's smallest state and unlike any other, known for its
                endless beaches, stellar nightlife, eclectic seafood, world-heritage listed architecture. Spread
                across just 3,702 km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a
                beach getaway, and one of the only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad)
                of Goa attracts as many international tourists as it does Indians, or even more so. </p>

            <p> The Goans are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year, the
                most famous being the New Year and Goa Carnival. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the
                best nightlife in India with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and
                discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists
                with relatively tighter pockets.</p>

            <p>For those of us perpetually confused between North Goa and South Goa, this might help - the state of
                Goa is divided into North Goa and South Goa. While North Goa is the nightlife hub where all the
                touristy beaches, flea markets, and beach shacks are located, South Goa is the land of luxurious
                resorts and laid-back beach vibes.

                Having been a Portuguese territory for almost 450 years, the Portuguese architecture is nowhere as
                prevalent as in Goa - visit one of the many whitewashed churches, crumbling forts or spectacular
                churches. The yellow houses with purple doors, ochre coloured mansions and oyester shell windows is
                what completes the kalieodscope of Goan architecture.

                Panjim, the capital city located in the centre overlooks the calm Mandovi River where the famous
                floating casinos of Goa are docked. The centre is well-connected with an international airport and
                roads and trains run from North to South part of Goa. With a coastline stretching for over 100
                kilometres, Goa has stunning beaches. While Baga and Calangute are more popular among the Indian
                family crowd, Anjuna and Arambol draw a lot of foreign tourists. The beaches in South Goa are
                relatively lesser explored, but some of them like Agonda and Palolem are more beautiful.

                Mumbai, the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra, is a spectacular paradox of chaos and
                hope, glamour and squalor, modernity and tradition. Famously known as the City of Dreams, Mumbai –
                formerly known as Bombay - Mumbai is a beautifully blended melting pot of cultures and lifestyles.</p>

            <p> city soaks in everything into its fabric, making it its very own. From upcoming actors struggling to
                make it big on the silver screen; from Bolly superstars to big industrialists to tribes of fisherman and
                slum dwellers, Mumbai is a city that proudly boasts of stories from different walks of human survival.
            </p>

            <p> One of the main centres in the country of art, culture, music, dance and theatre, Mumbai is a dynamic,
                cosmopolitan city that has been running for years solely on the indomitable spirit of the Mumbaikars.

                Located on the western tip of the Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat, Dwarka is an ancient city of India.
                Known as Devbhoomi Dwarka, Dwarka boasts of being the only city that is a part of both Char Dham (four
                principal holy places) and also Sapta Puris (seven sacred cities) mentioned in the Hindu religion.
                Dwarka was a part of the ancient kingdom of Krishna and Nageshwar Jyotirlinga Temple, one of the 12
                Jyotirlingas, is also located in Dwarka. For these reasons, it enjoys a remarkable religious
                significance and attracts thousands of pilgrims all year round. The beachside and the seashores are an
                added tourist attraction.</p>

            <p> Legend has it that the city was once engulfed by the sea and recent excavations reveal that a city did
                exist here. The name Dwarka translates to dwar meaning 'door' and ka meaning 'moksha' meaning the ‘door

                Aurangabad, which was declared by the Government as the Tourism Capital of Maharashtra back in 2010, is
                a famous tourist hub which greets its visitors with a richly woven tapestry of sights and sounds. The
                city got its name for being the erstwhile capital of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century AD.
                The town is used as the base to explore the extremely famous caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Daulatabad Fort
                which is renowned for its strong defence systems, Mausoleums of Aurangzeb and Bibi-Ka-Maqbara famous for
                its architecture and Grishneshwar Temple, one of the only 12 Shiva Jyotirlingas in India.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5cm;"> The most famous tourist attraction of Aurangabad is the Ajanta and Ellora
                Caves. Declared a World
                Heritage Site by UNESCO, the Ajanta Caves is home to 29 different caves, all of which showcase Buddhist
                artwork belonging to the period ranging from 200 B.C to 650 A.D. All paintings and sculptures in the
                caves were constructed painstakingly by Buddhist monks using only simple tools such as chisels and
                hammers. These paintings and sculptures portray a varied range of stories, starting from the Jataka
                Tales to intriguing accounts of ancient nymphs and princesses. The Ellora Caves, a little distance away
                from the Ajanta Caves, houses a total of 34 caves and has sculptures and paintings depicting not one,
                but three different religions – Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The sheer diversity of the sculptures,
                the architectural expertise, and the centuries of hard work undertaken by artisans are enough to leave
                you speechless.</p>

                A rapidly growing metropolis, an industrial hub, an educational hotspot, and a city with a
                magnificent past – Ahmedabad is one of the most important cities in Gujarat. Located on the banks of

            <p> Home to a plethora of remarkable temples like Swaminarayan Temple, intriguing museums and classy
                markets, with a little bit of colonial history attached to it, Ahmedabad is an excellent example of
                how a city can still retain every bit of its old-world charm while still rapidly progressing on the
                path of globalisation.</p>

            <p> Ahmedabad is famous for its textiles and its tie-dye bandhani handloom technique, which makes it a
                great place to shop. From bandhani sarees, dupattas to traditionally embroidered dress materials,
                and other local handicrafts.

                Beach town on the Konkan coastline, Ganpatipule has temples of Lord Ganesha as major attractions
                apart from the beautiful virgin beaches.</p>

            <p> Ganpatipule is a small town in the Ratnagiri district in Konkan region with a long stretch of
                pristine beaches, Ganpatipule is a perfect idyllic getaway in the slip of nature. Confluence of
                beach with river could be witnessed along with a hill shaped like Ganpati, the Hindu God of worship.
                The village of Ganapatipule is famous for its 400-year-old Ganesha temple. The idol is said to be a
                self-created monolith of Lord Ganesha, allegedly discovered 1600 years ago. Untouched by
                commercialism Ganapatipule makes for a great destination for peace-seekers, beach lovers and pilgrim
                alike. Ganpatipule also has water sports to offer between the months of November-May. Ganpatipule is
                typically clubbed with Ratnagiri and other smaller villages like Velneshwar, Malgund and Pawas for a
                perfect 2-3 day trip.
