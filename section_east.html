                brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indo mitable spirit of the self-made middle
                class, the city has created a beautiful juxtaposition of the old colonial -era charm with the

                pleasant weather most times of the year. During the monsoon season the rain-gods are more than generous
                as the town receives non-stop rains for days. The rains are in fact much needed for the flora and fauna
                of the area. Kurseong, the 'Land of White Orchids', gets its name from the flowers found in abundance on
                its hill-slopes. It's difficult not to fall in love with the view of tea plantations, lush green forests
                in the panoramic setting of snow-clad mountains. At sunset, you can see an amalgamation of the most
                beautiful colors in the sky. You can see the British remnants in the form of churches and school in the
                town. This small hill-town makes for a great stopover for tourists looking for a more peaceful
                alternative to Darjeeling.
